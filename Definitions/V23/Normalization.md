> [!NOTE] Goal
> Express a binary number (N) in the form:
> $$\pm1.xxxx_2 \times 2^{yyyy} $$
> The normalized form ensures that the floating-point representation begins with a '1' before the binary point, implicitly defining the MSB for precision

> [!NOTE] How to Normalize
> Ex. 1
>  Shifted the binary point three places to the left
> $$1000.01_2 \text{ to } 1.00001_2 \times2^3$$
> Ex. 2
> $$26.73_{10} \text { to } 10^1$$
> Shifted the binary point 1 place to the left
