- **Sequential logic elements** store data (state) and change their output only at specific, synchronized moments, typically defined by a clock signal. The primary sequential element is the register
- **Register:** A circuit that stores data
	- Uses a **clock signal** to determine when to update the stored value
	- **Edge-Triggered:** The register updates its stored value when the clock signal changes from 0 to 1
	- **Register with Write control**: This is a register that updates only on the clock edge and only if a write control input is 1
