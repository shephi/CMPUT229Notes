- Contains the address of the handler
	- Word Aligned => LSB should always be 0
	- LSB == 1 => is it in vectored mode
		- Make LSB = 0: it is the address of a table of pointers to exception handlers depending on its code
- For all synchronous exceptions (caused by instruction exectuion):
	- PC <- BASE field
- For interrupts (using vector mode):
	- PC <- BASE field + 4 X causeNumber
