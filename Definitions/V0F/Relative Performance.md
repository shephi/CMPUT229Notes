- Definitions:
	- Clock Period: 
		- The time between two consecutive low-to-high clock-signal transitions
	- Clock: 
		- Signal that oscillates between zero and one at a very regular interval:
	- Frequency: 
		- The number of clock cycles divided by the amount of time, measured in seconds, that it takes for those clock cycles to occur
	- Hertz: 
		- Unit to measure frequency
	- Seconds: 
		- Unit to measure frequency
