- Real Dependencies
	- Programs inherently contain dependencies that limit how much parallelism can be found
- Unpredictable Stalls: 
	- Not all stalls are predictable by the compiler
- Hardware Complexity and Power: 
	- Deep pipelines and complex dynamic scheduling hardware increase complexity, leading to challenges often referred to as the "power wall"
