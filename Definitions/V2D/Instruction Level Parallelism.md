- To increase ILP, two main hardware avenues exist:
	- **Deeper Pipeline:** *Dividing pipeline stages* further results in *less work per stage* and a potentially *shorter clock cycle*

	- **Multiple Issue:** (Wider Pipeline / Superscalar): **Replicating pipeline resources** to allow the processor to **start multiple instructions per clock cycle**, thereby achieving an Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) greater than one
