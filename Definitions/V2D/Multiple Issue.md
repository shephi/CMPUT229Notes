| **Static Multiple Issue**  | Compiler (or software) groups instructions into "issue packets" or "issue slots".                                                | The **compiler** is responsible for grouping instructions and detecting/avoiding hazards.               | This approach is often called **Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW)**. |
| **Dynamic Multiple Issue** | The CPU hardware continuously examines the incoming instruction stream and chooses which instructions to issue each clock cycle. | The **CPU hardware** dynamically detects and resolves hazards at run-time using specialized techniques. | This is the foundation of **superscalar** processors.                |
