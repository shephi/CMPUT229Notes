- The process of coordinating multiple threads or processors to safely access shared data using atomic instructions
	- Two processors sharing an are of memory
		- P1 writes then P2 reads
			- If P1 and P2 don't synchronize, what will P2 read?
	- Result depends on order of accesses <-> **Data Race**
