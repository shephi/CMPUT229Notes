- The process of coordinating **multiple threads** or processors to safely access shared data using atomic instructions
	- Two processors sharing an are of memory
		- P1 writes then P2 reads
			- If P1 and P2 don't synchronize, what will P2 read?
	- Result depends on order of accesses <-> **Data Race**
- Hardware support required
	- Atomic read/write memory operation
	- No other access to the location allowed between read and write
- Could be a single instruction
	- E.g. atomic swap of register <-> memory
