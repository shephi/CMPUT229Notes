-  **Structure:** Data moves between multiple levels, typically starting with fast, expensive **SRAM (Cache)**, **slower DRAM (Main Memory)**, and finally, slow, **large storage (Disk**). In this system, main memory essentially functions as a "cache" for the contents of the disk.
- Taking advantage of *Locality*
	- Copy recently accessed (and nearby) items from disk to smaller DRAM memory
		- main memory
	- Copy more recently accessed (and nearby) items from DRAM to smaller SRAM memory
		- Cache memory attached to CPU
