- Assembly language
	- symbolic representation of machine instructions
- Machine language
	- binary representation of machine instructions
- Assembler
	- Translates symbolic, human-readable instructions into the binary version the machine understands
- Compiler
	- A compiler is a program that translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or assembly language
- Cache Memory
	- A cache memory is smaller and faster than the main memory in a computer. The cache memory acts as a buffer between the processing speed of the processor and the speed of operation of the computers main memory.
- Embedded applications 
	- Embedded typically have stricter power and reliability requirements than general-purpose computers
	- Embedded systems are often designed to be **more power-efficient** and **highly reliable** for specific tasks, sometimes operating under strict constraints like limited energy, real-time performance, or harsh environments.
- Instruction set architecture 
	- Abstraction from hardware to low-level software
- Volatile memory
	- Holds data and programs while the machine is running,  but should not be used for storage between runs
	- Retains Data only if it is receiving power
- Secondary memory
	- Secondary memory (or auxiliary storage) is a non-volatile, long-term storage medium that is _not_ a part of the main memory, and is used to store the operating system, applications, and all user files permanently.
- Application binary interface
	- The Application Binary Interface (ABI) defines how a program interacts with the operating system and hardware at the binary level, including details like calling conventions, data representation, and register usage.
- Datapath
	- executes operations (like arithmetic or data movement).
- Control Unit 
	- The Control Unit of the processor controls the processor, memory, and I/O devices according to a programâ€™s instructions
- Operating System
	- Program that manages the resources of a computer for the benefit of the programs that run on that computer
- High-level programming language
	- a portable language that is composed of words and algebraic notation that can be translated by a compiler into assembly language.
